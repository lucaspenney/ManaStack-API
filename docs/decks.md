#Retrieving Decks

You can get decks by either their ID or their slug.

`api.manastack.com/deck?id=<id>`

`api.manastack.com/deck?slug=<slug>`


#Deck Lists

A deck list is different from loading a deck itself, as it does not contain deck metadata such as description/score  but instead contains the cards in the deck sorted/group in various ways for presentation as a decklist.

`api.manastack.com/deck/list?id=<id>`

`api.manastack.com/deck/list?slug=<slug>`
