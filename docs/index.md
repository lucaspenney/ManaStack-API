# ManaStack API Documentation

ManaStack provides a free-to-use API to help building Magic: The Gathering applications easier. 

Wizards of the Coast, Magic: The Gathering, and their logos are trademarks of Wizards of the Coast LLC in the United States and other countries. This web site is not affiliated with, endorsed, sponsored, or specifically approved by Wizards of the Coast LLC. This web site may use the trademarks and other intellectual property of Wizards of the Coast LLC, which is permitted under Wizards' Fan Site Policy. 

#Limits

There are currently no limits imposed on API usage, however individual IP addresses may be blocked for sending what should be considered an unreasonable amount of requests. The hope is to never have to require individually-distributed API keys to control access, so please take care to not cause too much of a burden on ManaStack's servers. This means caching results that don't change (card texts, sets, etc) and limiting requests to less than 1 per second on average.
